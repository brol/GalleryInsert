GalleryInsert is a plugin for dotclear.
This plugin aims to provide a simple way to add images/galeries to pages.

The main developement has been made by Fred. Many thanks to him for that great plugin.

I will try to maintain that plugin so that it can be used in recent dotclear releases.

# Installation

You can install that plugin from your dotclear administration area.

## Static code analysis

Analysis is made using [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) :

```
$ composer phpstan
```

The analysis is made with level 1 but the idea is to increase that level and fix more and more possible issues.

# Contributing
